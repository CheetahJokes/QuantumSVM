## QuantumSVM

QuantumSVM is a personal project aimed at exploring the application of quantum computing to support vector machines (SVMs) [https://arxiv.org/abs/1307.0471]. This project leverages quantum algorithms to  enhance the performance and capabilities of traditional SVMs as shown in the two benchmark performance examples.

## Features

- Implementation of quantum-enhanced SVM algorithm
- Comparison between classical and quantum SVM performance
- Example datasets for testing and benchmarking
- Documentation and usage examples below

## Installation

To install the necessary dependencies, run the following command:
``
pip install -r requirements.txt
``

## Usage
Run ``main.py``, which will give you the option to choose between ```iris``` and ```adhoc``` datasets. Choosing one will run both the classical and quantum SVM's, making the comparisons between the two evident.
