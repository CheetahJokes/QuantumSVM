# QuantumSVM

QuantumSVM is a personal project aimed at exploring the application of quantum computing to support vector machines (SVMs). This project leverages quantum algorithms to potentially enhance the performance and capabilities of traditional SVMs.

## Features

- Implementation of quantum-enhanced SVM algorithm
- Comparison between classical and quantum SVM performance
- Example datasets for testing and benchmarking
- Documentation and usage examples below

## Installation

To install the necessary dependencies, run the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
